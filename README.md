#Human Resource Management System (HRMS)
##Project Overview
The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) streamlines HR processes through two components:
  Admin Site: Manage employee data, leave requests, payroll, and HR operations.
  User Site: Employees can access their profiles, submit leave requests, and view payroll info.
The system uses .NET Core for the backend, and JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization.
